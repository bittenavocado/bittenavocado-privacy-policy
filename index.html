<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Bitten Avocado</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile game (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
  We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No account registration is required</li>
  <li>No names, email addresses, or contact information are collected</li>
  <li>No access to contacts, photos, files, or device data</li>
  <li>No precise location data is collected</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
<p>
  The App does not collect analytics, usage statistics, or diagnostic data.
</p>
<p>
  If this changes in the future (for example, if analytics or crash reporting tools are added), this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
</p>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>
  The App does not display advertisements.
</p>
<p>
  We do not use third-party ad networks and do not collect advertising identifiers such as the Google Advertising ID.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  The App does not use third-party services that collect user data.
</p>
<p>
  If third-party services are introduced in future updates, their data collection practices will be disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The App is suitable for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
  Since no personal data is collected, there is no risk of children’s data being stored or shared.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  Because the App does not collect or store personal data, no personal data is retained or transmitted.
</p>
<p>
  We take reasonable steps to ensure the App itself is secure and free from malicious data collection.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
</p>
<p>
  We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
